<h1>Format of a GRF File</h1>

A GRF file is a collection of "sprites", meaning rectangular graphics
objects that are drawn to the screen.  Examples are the vehicle graphics,
the landscape tiles, and pretty much everything that you see on the 
screen.
<p>
The GRF file is simply one sprite following after another until the end
of the file with no meta-information.  The list of sprites is terminated
by a zero-size sprite, and followed by what looks to be a 
four-byte checksum at the very end of the file.  TTD never even looks at the
checksum though.</p>

<h2>Sprite Info</h2>
Each sprite starts with a record of the following data:
<dl><dt>WORD size</dt>
<dd>Note, size can be either compressed or uncompressed size,
		see below.  It includes the following info bytes.</dd>
<dt>BYTE info</dt>
<dd>Bitcoded value that determines what type this sprite is.
<table class="wikitable"><tbody><tr><td>Bit</td><td>Val</td><td>Meaning</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>?</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>Size is compressed size if set<br>
			  If this bit is set, the given size is simply the
			  size in the file.  If it is unset, you *must*
			  decompress it to find out how large it is in the
			  file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>Has transparency (i.e. is a tile), see below</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">others</td><td>?</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
		If info==0xff, the sprite is a special type and has none
		of the following info byte, it is simply a stream of some
		bytes with the given size.  For example, these are used
		for specifying colour maps for the transparency feature and
		the company colours, as well as making a grey-scale image
		for the newspaper.  With TTDPatch, these sprites are so-called
		"actions", see TTDPatch's sprites.txt for more details.</dd>
<dt>BYTE ydim</dt><dd>How many lines there are in the sprite (y dimension)</dd>
<dt>WORD xdim</dt><dd>How many columns there are (x dimension)</dd>
<dt>WORD xrel</dt><dd>Horizontal offset.  The offset is counted from the base coordinate for each sprite.</dd>
<dt>WORD yrel</dt><dd>Vertical offset</dd>
</dl>

After this follows the actual compressed data.  If info bit 3 is not set, the 
data is simply a stream of pixels from left to right, and from top to bottom,
making up xdim*ydim bytes.
<p>
Finally, the file ends with a four byte checksum.  I do not know the algorithm
to calculate this, however it isn't important because this checksum is never
even looked at anyway.</p>

<h2>Tile sprites</h2>

If info bit 3 is set, the sprite is a tile and has some special transparency
information that is encoded like follows.  Each line is encoded separately 
and split into "chunks".  Each chunk contains pixels, but the chunks may
skip a few pixels which are then transparent.
<p>
The sprite data first starts off with a list of two-byte offsets, one for each
line.  These determine at which offset each line starts, counted from the
first info byte.  Then follow the chunks for the lines:</p>

<dl><dt>BYTE cinfo</dt><dd>The high bit is set if this is the last chunk in the line.
		The line need not be filled entirely, any remaining pixels 
		are simply transparent.
		The lower seven bits give the length of this chunk in pixels.</dd>
<dt>BYTE cofs</dt><dd>x offset at which this chunk starts.  The pixels between this
		chunk and the last one will be transparent.</dd>
</dl>
After this follow (cinfo &amp; 0x7f) bytes of pixels.

<h2>Compression algorithm</h2>

The compression used is a variation on the LZ77 algorithm which detects 
redundancy and losslessly reduces the size of the data.  Here's how the
compressed data looks in a GRF file.
<p>
The compressed stream contains either a pointer to an earlier location and
a length, which means that these bytes are copied over from the given location,
or it contains a length and a verbatim chunk which is copied to the output
stream.</p>

<dl><dt>BYTE code</dt><dd>The high bit of the code shows whether this is a verbatim
		chunk (not set)  or a repetition of earlier data (set).</dd></dl>

The meaning of the following bytes depends on whether the high bit of code is set. 
<p>
If the high bit is <i>not set</i>, what follows is code&amp;0x7f bytes of verbatim data,
or 0x80 bytes of verbatim data if code==0.</p>
<p>
If the high bit is <i>set</i>, the code has a slightly different meaning.  Bits 3 to 7
are now five bits defining the negative value of the length, that is how much data 
should be copied from the earlier location.  Bits 0 to 2 are the high bits of an offset, 
with the low bits being in the next byte.</p>

<dl><dt>BYTE lofs</dt><dd>Low bits of the offset</dd></dl>

Use this to extract length and offset:
<pre>unsigned long length = -(code &gt;&gt; 3);
unsigned long offset = ( (code &amp; 7) &lt;&lt; 8 ) | lofs;
</pre>

It's important that the variables are unsigned and at least two bytes large.
(But "code" must be a signed char, of course.)
<p>
The offset is counted backwards from the current location.  So you subtract
the offset from your position in the output stream and copy the given number
of bytes.</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much all you need to know about a GRF file!</p>
